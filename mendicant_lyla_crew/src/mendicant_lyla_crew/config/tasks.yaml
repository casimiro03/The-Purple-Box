define_ontology:
  description: >
    Define the initial linear algebra ontology for The Purple Box. 
    How do we represent financial assets (CEDEARs/ONs) as vector arrays using numpy? 
    Lyla, coordinate the Engineer's math with the Artist's vision.
  expected_output: >
    A structured schema (YAML or Python Class) defining  properties 
    and relationships, plus a visual description of how these 
    connections should "feel" in the UI.
  agent: lyla

implement_math_logic:
  description: >
    You will will the graph module of the purple box, the libraries we will use are numpy, scipy and networkx. The module should be able to represent financial assets as vector arrays and perform operations like similarity calculations, clustering, and pathfinding.
     Lyla will oversee the implementation to ensure it aligns with the defined ontology and the Artist's vision for the UI/UX.
     The Engineer should write clean, efficient, and well-documented code, and also create unit tests to validate the functionality of the module.
     we will start defining the data structure of the yaml file and the aggregation functions to create the graph.
  
  expected_output: >
    A functional Python module with unit tests.

design_ui_ux:
  description: >
    Design the UI/UX to visualize the ontology and data flow.
    The Artist should focus on motion and "lúdico" elements.
    Additionally, write the bullet points of the session so i can write text scripts for my videos in social medias "media lab"
    cuz im a content creator and i plan use animation and af to make it more engaging
  expected_output: >
    A set of design mockups and a style guide.
